# Word-Frequency-in-Classic-Novels
Word Frequency in Classic Novels Use web scraping and NLP to find the most frequent words  in one of two pieces of classic literature: Herman Melville's  novel, Moby Dick, or Peter Pan by J. M. Barrie Project Description: In this Project, you'll scrape a novel from the website Project Gutenberg  (which contains a large corpus of books) using the Python package requests.  Then you'll extract words from this web data using BeautifulSoup. Finally,  we'll dive into analyzing the distribution of words using the Natural  Language ToolKit (nltk).The natural language processing tools used here  apply to much of the data that data scientists encounter as a vast proportion  of the world's data is unstructured data and includes a great deal of text.
